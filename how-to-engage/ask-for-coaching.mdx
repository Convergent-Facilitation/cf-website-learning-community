# Ask for Coaching — and grow our library of learning resources

Convergent Facilitation is still young and the vision it holds for humanity is big. At the same time we don't know what the actual pathways to that vision are, what challenges will come up and how we can engage with them. To find out what Convergent Facilitation's true potential is for realigning humanity with life and to build our collective capacity to move towards this vision, we invite you to bring your challenges to the community by asking for a coaching call. It will be recorded and added to the Coaching Call Library](/coaching-calls) and contribute to our CF Commons. 

> *Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.*

## Where to ask

Share your need for coaching in [Coaching Requests](https://community.convergentfacilitation.org/c/coaching-requests/7) in our community.


## Hesitating?

Actively participating in a coaching call with a CF Coach can be daunting, especially knowing that the recording then goes online, accessible through a public website (but not searchable—you won't find this on Google!). And yet, this is an opportunity to model some of the qualities that we long for humanity to embody: 
- **humility** (even if we are holding responsibility for a group or project, there is still so much we don't know and that we can learn about)
- **vulnerability** (not knowing can be painful and scary, but just being with that, making visible that we don't know, instead of pretending that we know if massive shift)
- **courage** (yes, this is not without risk. However, we invite everyoen to risk their significance, again and again, as we believe it is key to create shifts in the world as it is).


## Self-Organise and Schedule

**Once you found a coach (in response to your post in [Coaching Requests](https://community.convergentfacilitation.org/c/coaching-requests/7)), please figure out between the two of you when you want to meet and then schedule the call by creating a new topic in [Community Events](https://community.convergentfaciliation.org) so that others from the community can join. If you want to use our Community Zoom room, you can find out how in our [FAQ/Guidelines](https://community.convergentfacilitation.org).
