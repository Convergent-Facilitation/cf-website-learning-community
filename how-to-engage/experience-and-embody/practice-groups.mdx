## Find and join a Practice Group

:point_right: **To join a CF Practice Group look for events called "Practice Group" on our [Community Calendar](/#events-overview)**. 

You do not need to signup to anything, you can just join those sessions via the link in the event. Just jumping in on a call can be indimidating if you don't know any of the people there. Practice Group events on the calendar are usually scheduled from within our [collaborative learning space on Hylo](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/co-create-on-hylo). You can let people know through a comment on that event that you are intending to join. 

 If you'd like to receive invites to your emailaddress for practice groups and others events that are scheduled by the community on Hylo you can receive [Calendar Invites](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/calendar-invites).


## Why participate in an online Practice Group
There are many shifts on many levels that most of us will need to go through to become effective Convergent Facilitators as well as practice various different skills to be able to steer and support a group in finding a decision that works for everyone. You can do some of this work by yourself and at some point you will likely reach a limit. Yet, stepping straight into holding an actual process might be beyond what you are able to do and it might not serve the group you want to support either. If you have a group who has willingness and capacity to practice with you—great! If not, we recommend joining a Practice Group that is offered by someone who already has at least some experience in applying Convergent Facilitation!

Practice Groups offer a safe container to try and fail and learn and try again and fail and learn and try again and fail and learn—you get it—*without* this creating impacts on anyone else. You can choose yourself how you want to engage: be it as a participant in a CF process or taking on the facilitator head (even if it is just for 5 minutes). From our experience even just practicing some aspect for just 10 minutes and then receiving feedback for 10-15 minutes will already offer so many learnings to _everyone_.

Also, you get to talk and engage with people who are already doing the work that you possibly long to do in the field. There is so much you can learn from them.

## Who is offering them
Practice Groups are generally offered by someone who already has some practical experience from applying CF and will be able to bring real-life challenges into the group. However, do not expect others in those practice groups (also not the person offering the group) to necessarily have a lot of experience in Convergent Facilitation, nor a complete understanding of the principles and process of Convergent Facilitation. If you want to engage with highly experienced Convergent Facilitators we recommend joining a coaching call, course or workshop.
