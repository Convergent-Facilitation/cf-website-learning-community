title: Join Live Events by CF Providers
---


We are only getting started again with offering Convergent Facilitation live events after having paused for about year to work on setting up new infrastructure. Live events offer you an opportunity to engage directly with our CF Providers, bring your questions and experiment and practice in a safe container. 

- You can find description for upcoming courses and workshops in our [Upcoming Offerings by CF Providers](/#offerings) section
- If you want to be notified about new workshops and courses we invite you sign up to our [Capacity-Growing Newsletter](/contact#newsletters)
- If you'd prefer for things (in addition) to just pop up in your inbox or on your calendar one by one you can directly receive invites to events via email: [Calendar Invites](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/calendar-invites)
