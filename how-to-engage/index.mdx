![four spheres](/img/four_spheres.webp)

Grow your own or others' Convergent Facilitation capacity within our three different *capacity building spheres*: 
- [Experience and Embody](#experience-and-embody-) :seedling: (Open to anyone)
- [Apply and Apprentice](#apply-and-apprentice-) :herb: (Open to anyone with self-assessment)
- [Coach and Teach](#coach-and-teach--) :deciduous_tree: (Currently not open to new people)

Support, maintain and shape the community engagement, agreements and infrastructure that make the above three spheres possible:
- [Steward and Contribute](#steward-and-contribute-) :sun_with_face: (Open to anyone with co-discernment)

You can participate in as many spheres as you would like to (of those you have access to). Which sphere you want to engage in depends on what you want to do and what your capacity and integration is. Wherever and how you choose to engage we invite you to join us in co-creating a learning web with us on Hylo: [Co-Create with us on Hylo ![hylo menu bar logo](/img/hylo-menu-bar.png)](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/co-create-on-hylo).

### Experience and Embody :seedling:

With this sphere we want to support anyone who wants to learn something new in relation to Convergent Facilitation to experience and embody (live) it. We believe that before you bring something to others it is important  that you integrate it enough within your own being first. So this sphere is where we imagine people to engage when they are new to Convergent Facilitation, but also whenever people come back to learning something that is entirely new to them or they have little integration of. 


This sphere is open to anyone who's interested in engaging with itâ€”just get started with it.

### Apply and Apprentice :herb:

Once you have a sense of sufficient embodiment (of some aspects) of Convergent Facilitation we invite you to start engaging within the _Apply and Apprentice_ sphere. This one focuses on applying Convergent Facilitation from within a web of apprentices and experienced Convergent Facilitation practitioners. You are invited to bring your challenges from your Convergent Facilitation projects to the community, ask for coaching, receive support and apprentice with more experienced CF facilitators and/or invite less experienced facilitators into your own projects. 


#### Access: Open to Anyone with Self-Assessment

There is no structural barrier to engaging within this sphere and we still want you to take serious that to *apply* (aspects of) CF we want you to first *live* it/them. For now this all we can offer you as guidance for self-assessment, we are working on a self-assessment matrix that will make this easier in the future.

### Coach and Teach  :deciduous_tree:

The _Coach and Teach_ sphere holds the lineage of Convergent Facilitation originating from Miki Kashtan. Coaching and teaching Convergent Facilitation is held within the so called *Lineage Experiment* within the [Nonviolent Global Liberation (NGL) Community](https://nglcommunity.org). Courses, workshops and coaching calls offered through this website and within the Convergent Facilitation Community are doing so within the lineage of Miki Kasthan. Currently, there is no capacity to train and endorse Convergent Facilitation practitioners as coaches and teachers outwith NGL and its "Lineage Experiment". In time, people might be invited to join the Lineage Experiment from within an apprenticeship offered via the CF community as long as they are also get engaged in NGL. At this point, therefore, there is no accessible pathway to get trained and endorsed as a Convergent Facilitation coach and teacher within the CF community.


#### Access: Currently closed to new people

We are currently still developing the pathway for experienced CF facilitators to join this sphere, and for now we are not open to invite anyone into this. We will update here once this changes.

### Steward and Contribute :sun_with_face:

The stewarding of Convergent Facilitation as an approach to integrative decision making, as well as the CF community, is held by the Convergent Facilitation Holding team from within the Nonviolent Global Liberation (NGL) Community. The Holding team is currently complete and not looking for new members. Team meetings can be observed by all members of the NGL community (anyone can become a Friend). 

In addition to the Holding team a number of sub-teams exist that members of the Convergent Facilitation community are invited to join if they wish to contribute. This doesn't require being part of NGL. **These teams are looking for new members and contributors!**

#### Access: Open to Anyone with Co-Discernment with Stewarding Teams

We'd love for you to join us in the stewarding! Whether it does actually make sense for you to join one or more teams and pick up one or more functions we would like to figure out together with you!
