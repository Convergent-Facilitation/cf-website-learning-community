# Commons & Community

You will find lots of learning resources on this website—we call them the *Convergent Facilitation Commons*. We offer them as gift to the world, co-created by our *Community of experienced and aspiring Convergent Facilitators* who couragesly come together to share their struggles in the open so that we all can learn. 

## Commons

Our library of CF Commons is steadily growing. Some of them are direclty accessible here on the website, others require you to sign up elsewhere, but they are all accessible to you no matter how much access to money you have. 

Our current library consists of:

- [Coaching Call Recordings](/coaching-calls)
- [Course and Workshop Recordings](/courses)
- [Materials (Books, Handouts)](/materials)
- [An App to support CF Processes](https://www.convergence.tools)

> *We must provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.* — Ivan Illich, Deschooling Society


## Community

Commons need community, and community need commons. We are building community here and we would love if you join us: [community.convergentfacilitation.org](https://community.convergentfacilitation.org/). We learn together, we practice together, we struggle together and we work together on various projects! 

One key pathway through which we are co-creating the CF commons are coaching calls: someone who (struggles to) apply Convergent Facilitation receives live coaching from an experienced Convergent Facilitator, we record the call and add it to our library of coaching calls. And there's much more that we do. 

Joining our community will also give you access to some of our shared community resources like our Zoom room that you can use for CF practice spaces or CF projects.
