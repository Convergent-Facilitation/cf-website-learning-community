**Be pro-active in your learning: post your needs and challenges on our collaborative community space on Hylo** (find out here how to join :point_right: [Co-Create a Learning Web on Hylo](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/co-create-on-hylo)).

Convergent Facilitation is dynamic: What skills, qualities, context and structures do we need so that we can make decisions together? 

Our Convergent Facilitation community is itself also a running experiment. How can we let the learning be led by emerging questions, requests and participants'own examples? How can we become an interactive web of learners, experimentors, and facilitators?

> *We must provide all who want to learn with access to available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who want to learn it from them; and, finally furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenge known.*
