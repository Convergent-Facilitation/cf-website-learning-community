# Access to Community Resources

To keep the threshold as low as possible for anyone to access Convergent Facilitation learning resources we offers as much as possible directly on this website without any registration required. For some things we do want to ask people to register so that we can more easily care for those resources together.

These resources include:
- our Google Drive Cloud Storage
- our Community Zoom Room
- non-public recordings
