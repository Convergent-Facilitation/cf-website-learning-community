Some of our events like workshops and courses we announce in the newsletter, and we try to also do so for Coaching Calls with CF providers as well as Practice Group sessions. Depending on capacity on our end as well as how much ahead those events are scheduled we might not always be able to do so. In addition, you might prefer for any event to show up directly on your own calendar. 

To get immediately notified about any newly scheduled events (and possibly have them show up on your calendar) let us know here:
