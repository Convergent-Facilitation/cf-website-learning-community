title: Schedule Events Through Hylo
---

:construction: :seedling: **WORK IN PROGRESS**  :seedling: :construction:

You can schedule events on our [Community Calendar](/#events-overview) by posting an event in our Hylo Group. We have set up a system so that new Events from Hylo will automatically be added to our community calendar. 

Note:
- Hylo currently does not offer recurring events, i.e. if your event happens more than once you will need to manually schedule it for each time
- The time on Hylo (and also the community calendar) is displayed in your local (or rather your computer's operating system's default) time. It will be shown for everyone else in *their* local time

:::caution IN DEVELOPMENT
This feature is not live yet. This means that events you schedule on Hylo are not yet automatically transferred to our community calendar. We will remove this box here once the feature is up and running.
