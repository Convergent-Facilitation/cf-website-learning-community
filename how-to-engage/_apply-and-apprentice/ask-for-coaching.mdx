# Ask for Coaching — and grow our library of learning resources

Convergent Facilitation is still young and the vision it holds for humanity is big. At the same time we don't know what the actual pathways to that vision are, what challenges will come up and how we can engage with them. To find out what Convergent Facilitation's true potential is for realigning humanity with life and to build our collective capacity to move towards this vision, we invite you to bring your challenges to the community by asking for a coaching call. It will be recorded, feature in our [Coaching Call Library](/coaching-calls) and contribute to our growing understanding and learning resources. 

> *Knowledge emerges only through invention and re-invention, through the restless, impatient continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.*

## Where to ask

We invite you to share your challenge on Hylo so that any of the CF Coaches can respond. If you'd prefer not to do this, please [send us a message](/contact#reach-out) so that we can reach out to the group of CF Coaches ourselves.

## Hesitating?

Actively participating in a coaching call with a CF Coach can be daunting, especially knowing that the recording then goes online, accessible through a public website (but not searchable—you won't find this one google!). And yet, this is an opportunity to model some of the qualities that we long for humanity to embody: 
- **humility** (even if we are holding responsibility for a group or project, there is still so much we don't know and that we can learn about)
- **vulnerability** (not knowing can be painful and scary. However, think how powerful and inspiring it is to witness in others...)
- **courage** (yes, this is not without risk. However, we invite everyoen to risk their significance, again and again, as we believe it is key to create shifts in the world as it is).


## Self-Organise and Schedule

**Once you found a provider, please figure out between the two of you when you want to meet and [schedule the call through Hylo](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/schedule-events-through-hylo) so that others from the community can join and use our CF [Community Zoom Room](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/community-zoom-room).**
