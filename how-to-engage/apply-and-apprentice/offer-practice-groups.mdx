title: Offer a Practice Group

## Why offer a Practice Group
As someone who has gathered Convergent Facilitation experience in the field already we invite you to offer an online Practice Group to the community. You will be the one holding the space, being responsible for scheduling the call,  bringing real-life challenges from your field of application or offering practice scenarios to the group.

We see offering a Practice Group as a powerful step for you to co-hold your work together with others, digest and harvest previous facilitations as well as being able to practice and experiment for upcoming processes. It is also in service to people who are just getting started with CF. Practising with a person who is bringing their *real* challenges from the field provides a powerful learning opportunity in a safe environment. 

## Preparatory steps to offering a Practice Group

### Decide on when and how often

Some practice groups are ongoing, but they don't have to. We invite you to schedule something that suits your needs and availability. If you have some flexibility regarding when you might want to schedule it, you could post an offering on Hylo prior to scheduling it to ask who would be interested in joining and what times and days might generally work for them. Our community is scattered across the globe so you will likely find people at any time of our 24 hour day :wink: 


### Find a place (e.g. Zoom) to offer your session

If you have Zoom room or other service that you want to use for this feel free to use that one. If you need a Zoom room you can use our [Community Zoom Room](../platforms-and-co-creation/community-zoom-room). 

### Optional: Folder for materials and recordings

If you deem it useful for your call to have a shared folder / notes document we invite you to make use of our Community Cloud Storage:
- create a folder within `CF Practice Groups` on our Open Access Community Storage if you don't mind others who are not participating in the practice group accessing it (note, it is possible to move this later to restricted access if needed)
- ask for a private folder within our Restricted Access Community Storage if you want to protect sensitive content or imagine that this would create a safer space for you group

### Draft your title and description

#### Title

We recommend that you chose a title
- that has "CF Practice Group" in it so people know that it is a CF Practice Group
- that has your name in it, so that people can easily recognize it
- possibly says something about the context 
- has a maximum of 50 characters (that's the limit for post titles on [Hylo](../platforms-and-co-creation/co-create-on-hylo)

For example: 
- **CF Practice Group w/ Menaka: CF in Communities** (46 characters)
- **CF Practice Group w/ Fabian: CF with Children** (45 characters)


## Post your Practice Group event(s) on our Community Calendar

Some notes on posting on Hylo:
- Events cannot repeat (yet), so if your practice group will happen more than once you will need to schedule each event manually
