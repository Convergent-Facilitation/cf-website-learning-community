# Ask for Coaching — and grow our library of learning resources

Convergent Facilitation is still young and the vision it holds within for humanity is big. At the same time we don't know what the actual pathway to that vision is, what challenges will come up and how we can engage with them. To find out what Convergent Facilitation's true potential is for realigning humanity again with life and to build our collective capacity to be able to move through all the challenges and obstacles that will—no doubt—arise along the way we invite you to bring you challenges to the community by asking for a coaching call. The recording of that coaching call will then go into our [Coaching Call Library](/coaching-calls) and contribute to our growing understanding and learning resources. 

## Where to ask

We'd prefer for you to share your challenge on Hylo so that any of the CF Coaches can respond. If that is something that you are not willing or able to do at this point please [send us a message](/contact#reach-out) so that we can reach out to the group of CF Coaches. 

## Hesitating?

Actively participating in a coaching with a CF Coach of which the recording then goes online, accessible through a public (but not searchable—you won't find this one google!) website can be daunting, we know! And yet, with this we model to the world some of the qualities that we envision for humanity to embody: 
- humility (even if we are holding responsibilty for a group or project there is still so much we don't know and that we can learn)
- vulnerability (not knowing can be so painful and scary—and is so powerful and inspiring to witness in others!)
- courage (yes, this is not without risk—and again risking our own significance again and again is what we think is so needed to create the shift in the world that is needed)
