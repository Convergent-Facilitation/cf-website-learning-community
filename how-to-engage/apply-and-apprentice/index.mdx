The purpose of this sphere is to support those of you who have been learning Convergent Facilitation by mainly applying it in your daily lives to take significant steps towards sharing it with others and facilitating CF processes. We'll support you with coaching and by inviting you to apprentice with more experienced facilitators, lead a practice group, and actively interact on Hylo. 


## Goals

- Go out and apply Convergent Facilitation supported by a web of other practitioners
- Deepen your Convergent Facilitation skills by apprenticing with experienced Convergent Facilitation practitioners
- Co-Create a powerful library of publicly available coaching calls by bringing your real-life challenges into the community and receiving coaching from a Convergent Facilitation coach
- Support others in practicing Convergent Facilitation by holding Practice Group sessions
