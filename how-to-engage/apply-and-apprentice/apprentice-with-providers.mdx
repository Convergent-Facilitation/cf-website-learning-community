# Apprentice with other Facilitators

We've witnessed time and time again that taking the leap from learning about Convergent Facilitation, becoming familiar with the process and principles and bringing it into our daily lives to applying it in a context that is beyond our immediate personal lives is extremely difficult for people who are not doing such facilitation work and mediation work with groups already in their work.

We therefore want to create the structures so that those who lead Convergent Facilitation processes regularly can find apprentices to take with them so that we can collectively build Convergent Facilitation Capacity *while* working impactful projects.

We are still in the process of building the structures to easily bring together facilitators and apprentices. We will update here and let you in our newsletter once this is in place.
