# Apprentice with other Facilitators

We've witnessed time and time again that taking the leap from bringing Convergent Facilitation into our daily lives into contexts that are beyond our immediate personal lives is difficult. This is particularly true for people who haven't yet got an established practice of facilitating groups in a voluntary or professional capacity.

We therefore want to create structures enabling those who lead Convergent Facilitation processes regularly to find apprentices to work with them and collectively build Convergent Facilitation Capacity *while* being involved in impactful projects.

We are still in the process of building the structures to easily bring together facilitators and apprentices. We will update here and let you in our newsletter once this is in place.
