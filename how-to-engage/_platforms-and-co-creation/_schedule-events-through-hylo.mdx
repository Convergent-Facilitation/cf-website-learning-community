title: Schedule Events Through Hylo
---

You can schedule events on our [Community Calendar](/#events-overview) by posting an event in our [Hylo group](/how-to-engage/platforms-and-co-creation/co-create-on-hylo). We have set up a system so that new events from Hylo will automatically be added to our community calendar. 

Note:
- Hylo currently does not offer recurring events, i.e. if your event happens more than once, you will need to manually schedule it for each time.
- The time on Hylo (and also on the community calendar) is displayed in your local (or rather your computer's operating system's default) time. It will show for everyone else in *their* local time.

:::caution LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY
This feature is not yet fully operational: If you update or delete events the changes will not automatically show up on the google calendar. If you want to delete or update and event you posted on Hylo please [reach out](/contact#reach-out).
