# Use our Community Zoom Room

To support you all in coming together virtually, we offer a dedicated Zoom room for community events. You can use it without any time limit (free Zoom rooms have a 40min time limit built in). 

## Get the Zoom Room Details
To care for purpose-aligned usage of this Zoom room, we are not sharing the details here on the website. We will send them to you via email. To receive the Zoom room details, you will need to be registered for community access already. If you are not yet registered, you will get an email with a link to a form to request it. So either way, you can go ahead and put your email into the field below.

## Claim Host

To manage participants, create breakout rooms, temporarely enable the waiting room, or record your meeting, you need to *claim host* first. You will receive the host key, with other details, in the email.

To claim host, open the participants panel, click on `Claim Host` and enter the 6 digit host key. 

## Recording your Meetings

You might want to record your meetings. You have two options:
- recording locally, which means that the recording will be saved on your computer
- recording to cloud, which means that it will automatically upload to our CF Google Drive and someone from the Community Support Team will move it to your group's shared folder

**If you record to the cloud, please name the date and the name of your group (if this is a practice group session) or your meeting's purpose immediately after starting the recording, e.g. `Today is 13 Oct 2023 and this is the Practice Group XYZ`. This enables members of the Community Support Team to easily move the recording to the relevant folder.**
