# Access to Community Resources

To keep the threshold as low as possible for anyone to access Convergent Facilitation learning resources, we offer as many of them as possible, directly on this website, without any registration required. For certain things, we ask people to register. This enables us to more easily care for those resources together.

Resources requiring registration include:
- Our Google Drive Cloud Storage
- Our Community Zoom Room
- Non-public recordings
