Some of our events like workshops and courses we announce in the newsletter, and we try to also do so for coaching calls with CF providers as well as any community organized events like [practice sessions](how-to-engage/practice-session). Depending on capacity on our end as well as how early events are scheduled we might not always be able to announce things in the newsletter. So if you want to make sure you don't miss anything we recommend that you register for calendar invites above.
