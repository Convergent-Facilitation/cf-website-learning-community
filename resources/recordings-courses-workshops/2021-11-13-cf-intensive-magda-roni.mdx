# Convergent Facilitation Intensive with [Magda Baranska](/about#magda-baranska) and [Roni Wiener](/about#roni-wiener) (2021)


At the Convergent Facilitation (CF) Intensive we offered a comprehensive introduction to collaborative decision making. We would love for more people to learn Convergent Facilitation and we understand not everyone can attend a live workshop, so we chose to make the recordings and materials availabe.

## Original Course Invitation

> The Convergent Facilitation (CF) Intensive offers a comprehensive introduction to collaborative decision making. We invite you to learn how to effectively arrive at group decisions that everyone can accept as their own. The skills you acquire will help you make group decisions more easily and effectively at home, in your work, and in your communities. This is an opportunity to learn the basics of the CF process and principles or deepen your practice, **no prior experience with CF is needed.**
