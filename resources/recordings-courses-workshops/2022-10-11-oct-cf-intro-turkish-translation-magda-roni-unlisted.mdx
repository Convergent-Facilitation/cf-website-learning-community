## About CF Introduction Courses

The culture we live in often leads to a split between two opposing views when a problem arises. Disagreements lead to unsustainable solutions like compromise and weary power struggles that come from *either this or that* kind of thinking. In this Convergent Facilitation (CF) course, we want to support making collaborative decisions through choices that foster efficiency, cooperation, participation and togetherness.

## We invite you to an approach where:

- all needs are taken into account
- trust is built from the very beginning, even across power differences
- concerns are surfaced and transformed through dialogue
- conflicts are turned into dilemmas that the group feels energized to solve together

## What If I’ve Already Taken A CF Intensive Or Introduction Course?

Some people have shared with us that participating in these courses multiple times helps to deepen their understanding. If this may be true for you, you are welcome to join. Otherwise, we invite you to explore other options like advanced CF offerings and coaching calls.
