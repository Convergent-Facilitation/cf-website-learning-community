title: "CF Workshop: Transforming Inner Obstacles to Integrating Everyone's Needs w/ Roni & Verene (2023)"
date: 2023-11-30
description: "When we commit to making decisions that work for everyone, we often discover habits and ways of thinking that get in the way. Many people find it difficult to fully take in what matters to others without giving up on their own perspective. We also tend to get stuck because we cannot imagine a solution that would care for everyoneâ€™s needs.

In this workshop, we've explored pathways for transforming inner obstacles to integration. "
