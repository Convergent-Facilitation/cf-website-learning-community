# Framing For Integration with [Roni Wiener](/about#roni-wiener)(2022)

## What Could You Make Possible If You Told A Different Story?

Humans are constantly engaging in collective meaning-making. We tell each other stories about what is happening to create a shared reality. These stories hold the power to shift everyone’s focus and create new openings.

When we want to bring people together around a shared purpose, we can frame or reframe any situation with stories that invite more choice, connection, and integration. When we facilitate, these stories create a foundation for making decisions that care for everyone’s needs.


## Recordings

In this course, Roni offered a comprehensive introduction to developing framing awareness and skills.

**You can learn how to:**

- discern what story to tell when
- notice different stories in the space and inside you
- identify the underlying purpose and beliefs
- reframe without discounting or disagreeing with the previous frame
- shift internalised stories that do not serve you or others
