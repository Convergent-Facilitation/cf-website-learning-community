At the Convergent Facilitation (CF) Intensive we offered a comprehensive introduction to collaborative decision making. We would love for more people to learn Convergent Facilitation and we understand not everyone can attend a live workshop, so we chose to make the recordings and materials available. For more information about the course see the original invitation below.

These recordings and materials are being offered within a gift economy model to support more financial equity and help move our society toward a needs-based distribution of resources. We invite you to contribute an amount that feels generous and financially sustainable for you. If you are not able to contribute any amount, please choose zero. By contributing more, you are making the recordings and materials more accessible to people who are not able to contribute as much. 

## Original Invitation

Is it possible to make group decisions that everyone feels good about? How do you find solutions that accommodate conflicting opinions? What if some people oppose the proposed solution?

The Convergent Facilitation (CF) Intensive offers a comprehensive introduction to collaborative decision making. We invite you to learn how to effectively arrive at group decisions that everyone can accept as their own. The skills you acquire can help you with group decisions at home, in your work, and in your communities.

### About Convergent Facilitation

Convergent Facilitation is a group decision-making process that’s designed to build trust from the very beginning, to surface concerns and address them, and to turn conflicts into dilemmas that the group feels energized to solve together.
If you would like to learn more about the history and applications of this process before attending the workshop, you can explore the Convergent Facilitation website.

### What Do We Plan To Do Together?

- We plan to offer three 1.5 hour learning sessions each day, with 2 short breaks between sessions. Each day will end with some flexible time for feedback, questions, and connection (fondly known as “the afterparty”)
- During the 6 main sessions, Roni and Magda will share information about Convergent Facilitation. We will offer examples from our years of experience with integrative group decisions and answer any clarifying questions
- If you are new to CF, we will cover the basics you need to get started
- If you are already familiar with CF, we will offer ways to deepen your practice and expand your skills
- In each session, we will offer a small group practice activity to help you integrate and remember what you learn
- Practice activity topics include listening for underlying needs (noncontroversial essence), using thresholds, creating proposals, and engaging with objections
