> I appreciate the clarity I've experienced in the workshop, along with that the handouts were so easy to follow and filled with beautiful images and diagrams. — Nel

> Magda and Roni created a fertile learning environment for all of us to grow, and this with more than 100 participants! Invitations to pose questions & sharing concepts were well balanced. Genius use of breakout rooms to help us practice what we learned. Many thanks to the whole team. — Francine

> I found the course to be very clearly laid out, so that I could easily grasp the concepts and see how I might apply them. Roni and Manga worked together beautifully as co-facilitators. They combined flexibility and spontaneity with a strong intention to deliver the material within the allotted time. I learned a lot just from watching them facilitate. I found this course was very much worth the time and money I devoted to it. — Yehudit Lieberman

> Powerful skills for converging on decisions for facilitators of all backgrounds and skill levels. — Michelle Clarke

> This workshop opened up my mind to a new way of collaborative decision making. — Kate Reynolds

> I highly recommend Roni and Magda's course because they model and bring out of others how to provide a middle-ground option, without compromise, and without side-taking so common to us all at this point in time. The beauty is that the practice you get with the course, enables you to put this approach directly to use the very same day. — Gail Reich

> I can’t wait to start sharing and integrating this in my conversations with people that know these things matter to me, so I want to acknowledge just the partnership for you two, and how it supported me and I’m deeply grateful. — Punita

> Thank you to everyone that was involved, and I also want to say that I am reading Miki's book right now and the way that you presented the concept I really understood it better, like the combination of the book and the lectures. — Yuval
