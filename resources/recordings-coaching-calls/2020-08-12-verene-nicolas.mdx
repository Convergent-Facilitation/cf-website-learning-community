title: Thresholds w/ Verene Nicolas [12 Aug 2020]
coach: Verene Nicolas
coach_lower_case: verene-nicolas
description: "Verene will offer coaching on Thresholds. The capacity to both integrate dissent and discern willingness is one of the key skills that differentiates CF from other methods of collaborative decision making. It includes asking carefully crafted show-of-hands questions, according to a low to high threshold spectrum. In this session, we will practice when to lean towards a low, medium, or high threshold, as well as how to craft the questions themselves.  "
