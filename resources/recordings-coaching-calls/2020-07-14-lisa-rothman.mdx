coach: Lisa Rothman
coach_lower_case: lisa-rothman
description: "On this call, Lisa discusses strategies for maximizing collaboration when time is tight.  Topics discussed include how to let go of attachment to outcome in the face of time pressure, strategies for raising the threshold of willingness while lowering the stakes, how to check to see what the cost of having a majority vote if time runs out will be for the group, what to do when you canâ€™t find the noncontroversial essence in the moment, and how to describe what Convergent Facilitation is so that a group has enough context to buy into the process."
