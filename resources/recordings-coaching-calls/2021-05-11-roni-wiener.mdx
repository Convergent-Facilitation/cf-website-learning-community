description: "Those of us who love Nonviolent Communication and Convergent Facilitation often want to share the joy with others. We might think that everyone wants to learn everything about these wonderful tools for attending to everyone's needs, and feel surprised when people seem disinterested or even irritated. This coaching call is an opportunity to explore effective approaches for sharing principles and practices from Convergent Facilitation. Please bring your challenges and insights! "
