title: CF for large multi-stakeholder groups w/ Lisa Rothman [14 Sep 2021]
coach: Lisa Rothman
coach_lower_case: lisa-rothman
description: "Interested in facilitating a large (25 person or more) multi-stakeholder group decision? Already in the middle of one?  Bring your questions, challenges and concerns.  Possiblilites of what we can cover include coming up with strategies for getting as much alignment as possible before the first meeting, what to say to kick off that first meeting, how to keep things moving forward with large groups of people, and what to do if there's only token or no representation of a particular stakeholder group."
