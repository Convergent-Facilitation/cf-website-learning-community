title: Thresholds of Willingness - Lisa Rothman (Recording Coaching Call 12 Oct 2020)
coach: Lisa Rothman
coach_lower_case: lisa-rothman
description: "Determining where to set the Threshold of Willingness is essential for maximizing creativity and conserving the group's energy and your own.  If it's too high for the context, you risk squelching input.  Too low, and resentment mounts and fatigue grows.  Lisa looks forward to in depth exploration and practice of this skill with you! "
