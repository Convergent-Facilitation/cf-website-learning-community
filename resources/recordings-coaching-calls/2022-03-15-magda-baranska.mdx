title: The power of reflecting back and curiosity  w/ Magda Baranska [15 Mar 2022]
coach: Magda Baranska
coach_lower_case: magda-baranska
description: "The CF facilitation is a process of discovery of whatâ€™s important for a group and how this can be attended to. Curiosity and reflecting back support me in this discovery. You are invited to explore together in what ways it could be supportive for you and what are the ways you would like to express your curiosity and reflect back what you heard.  Note, English is Magda's second language and sometimes it is a stretch for her to express herself precisely and understand others instantly. Making it visible helps Magda to relax. (for CF Newsletter and Cf Website)"
