title: Challenges encountered during CF facilitation and Practice of Self-Connection w/ Verene Nicolas [25 Oct 2020]
coach: Verene Nicolas
coach_lower_case: verene-nicolas
description: "People who encounter specific challenges or have questions about how to navigate certain situations whilst facilitating a CF process will have a chance to explore those with me and the group. If we have time, we'll also practice how to discern what is alive in us when we facilitate and what and how to share it with the group to reach our purpose."
