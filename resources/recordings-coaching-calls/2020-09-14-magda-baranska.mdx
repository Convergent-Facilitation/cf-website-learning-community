title: Noncontroversial essence w/ Magda Baranska [14 Sep 2020]
coach: Magda Baranska

description: "Magda will be leading a practice session on finding the Noncontroversial Essence. She says, In my opinion Noncontroversial Essence is the essence of Convergent Facilitation, because in order to make a decision that everyone in a room is supporting, we usually need to name what people have in common. This is a chance to develop your capacity, flow, and confidence in this key part of Convergent Facilitation."
