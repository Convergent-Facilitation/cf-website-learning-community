title: CF in social movements w/ Mariam Gafforio [25 Apr 2021]
coach: Mariam Gafforio
coach_lower_case: mariam-gafforio
description: "Do you have questions about applying Convergent Facilitation in your work with social movements? When we are supporting decision-making as part of social change work, we can encounter all sorts of dynamics that may not come up in other scenarios, all-volunteer groups, people who are overworked and underpaid, the assumption of Consensus process, strong ideological thinking, trauma related to the issues that people are passionate about, and more. Please bring your experiences and questions related to using CF in these kinds of contexts and let's explore it together."
