title: Framing (and reframing) w/ Roni Wiener [08 Jan 2021]
coach: Roni Wiener
coach_lower_case: roni-wiener
description: "We'll welcome the new year with a playful exploration of reframing, the art of guiding a group by choosing which stories to tell about what is happening. Roni will offer a brief framing on framing, followed by a game of whose frame is it anyway? Don't worry, we'll still have time for coaching, so bring any specific challenges from your CF practice."
