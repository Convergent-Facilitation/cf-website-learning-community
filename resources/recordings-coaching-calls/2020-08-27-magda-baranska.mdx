title: Following intuition while asking for and engaging with dissent - Magda Baranska (Recording Coaching Call 27 Aug 2020)
coach: Magda Baranska
coach_lower_case: magda-baranska
description: "Magda will offer a session focused on Following intuition while asking for and engaging with dissent. Facilitation is an art and requires reading the room very quickly and in detail. This is especially true when it comes to dissent, because often people feel either vulnerable or agitated while sharing a different perspective or concerns. In this session we will practice what it would be like to follow your intuition and how to follow it while facilitating. Please bring your own situation(s) so we can work with real life examples."
