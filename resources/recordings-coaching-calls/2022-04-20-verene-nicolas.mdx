title: Engaging with Dissent w/ Verene Nicolas [20 Apr 2022]
coach: Verene Nicolas
coach_lower_case: verene-nicolas
description: "Facilitation is an art and requires reading the room very quickly and in detail. This is especially true when it comes to dissent, because often people feel either vulnerable or agitated while sharing a different perspective or concerns. In this session we will practice what it would be like to follow your intuition and how to follow it while facilitating. Please bring your own situation(s) so we can work with real life examples."
