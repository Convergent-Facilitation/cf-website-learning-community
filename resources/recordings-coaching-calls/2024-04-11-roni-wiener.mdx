## Key points from the call

1. Introducing CF: Roni emphasized the importance of naturally engaging with people about CF without necessarily trying to explain or convince them about the process upfront. The approach should be about offering help or support in a way that’s contextually relevant to people’s needs or situations.

2. Engaging Stakeholders: There was a strong focus on ensuring that all necessary stakeholders are not just aware of but are also committed to the CF process. This includes gaining explicit consent from decision-makers not to override the collaborative process and ensuring participants are genuinely willing to commit time and make an effort.

3. Time Estimates for CF Processes: Estimates vary widely depending on factors like the decision’s complexity, the number of people involved, and their capacity for effective communication. A simpler decision with fewer participants could be facilitated in a shorter timeframe (e.g., under an hour), while more complex situations with more stakeholders might need several sessions spread out over months or condensed into a few intensive days.

4. Adaptability and Openness: Roni highlighted the importance of remaining open and adaptable throughout the CF process, recognizing that plans might need to change based on new information, group dynamics, or emerging needs.

5. Practical Applications: Participants shared specific contexts and scenarios where they aimed to apply CF, including organizational decisions, community agreements, and family discussions. These examples underscored the versatility of CF but also the nuances involved in applying it across different settings.

6. Support and Learning: The group discussed the value of having a supportive community to learn from and practice with. There was also an expression of appreciation for the organized and clear facilitation style that Roni demonstrated, which offered a model for participants to learn from.

7. Further Inquiry and Support: Participants expressed interest in learning more about CF, including how to estimate adequate time for processes and engage stakeholders effectively. There was also an interest in donating or contributing towards Roni’s facilitation work, indicating a desire to support and further engage with the practice of CF.

Overall, the conversation revealed a keen interest in understanding and applying CF more deeply, recognizing both its potential impact and the challenges involved in its implementation across various contexts.
