title: Responding to challenging moments w/ Roni Wiener [31 Mar 2021]
coach: Roni Wiener
coach_lower_case: roni-wiener
description: "How do you respond when a participant accuses someone else of derailing the process? What do you do when you realize you've made a mistake, you don't know how to proceed, or you're triggered to a point of being unable to continue facilitating? Bring your own challenges and we'll explore how to support you and the group, increase trust, move the group toward purpose, and honor your limits."
