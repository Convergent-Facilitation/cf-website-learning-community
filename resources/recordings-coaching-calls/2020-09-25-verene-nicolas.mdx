title: Art of transparent facilitation w/ Verene Nicolas [25 Sep 2020]
coach: Verene Nicolas
coach_lower_case: verene-nicolas
description: "One of the key skills of CF is to be transparent about the choices we make as the process is unfolding. This builds trust as we model collaboration by involving people in when and how to transition from one step to the next. However, there are potential pitfalls when revealing what lives in us in any particular moment. In this session, we'll practice how to express transparently as well as explore when to be transparent or not."
