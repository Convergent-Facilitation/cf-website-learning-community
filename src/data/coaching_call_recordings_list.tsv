2020-08-12	559450	Verene Nicolas	Thresholds	Verene will offer coaching on Thresholds.

It includes asking carefully crafted show-of-hands questions, according to a low to high threshold spectrum. In this session, we will practice when to lean towards a low, medium, or high threshold, as well as how to craft the questions themselves.  	fwIFVFLw2qI	thresholds','verene'
2020-10-12	558840	Lisa Rothman	Thresholds of Willingness	Determining where to set the Threshold of Willingness is essential for maximizing creativity and conserving the group's energy and your own.

2020-09-25	559010	Verene Nicolas	Art of transparent facilitation	One of the key skills of CF is to be transparent about the choices we make as the process is unfolding. This builds trust as we model collaboration by involving people in when and how to transition from one step to the next. However, there are potential pitfalls when revealing what lives in us in any particular moment. In this session, we'll practice how to express transparently as well as explore when to be transparent or not.	sXEZd40r5j0
