When we ask questions or make requests, our wording and delivery deeply influence the responses we receive. How can we use thresholds effectively to support movement, collaboration, and connection?

The term 'threshold' refers to encouraging or limiting the likelihood of people responding or objecting. In Convergent Facilitation, we aim to use thresholds that invite ‚Äújust enough‚Äù interaction so we can move towards a decision without leaving anyone behind. We adjust our thresholds to help people speak up or step back depending on what we believe serves the group in each moment. Supportive thresholds help the group stay together and save time by focusing on information that moves us forward. 

<!--truncate-->

### Why are thresholds important?
Using thresholds effectivey will help you:
- compensate for power differences
- invite more diverse perspectives
- encourage people to speak up (or not)
- keep conversations focused
- avoid "long speeches" that don't support the group
- get things done quickly without leaving anyone behind
- resolve or prevent many other common challenges in meetings



## Sessions 
### 1st session (Jun 05): Content sharing and live practice

**Topics will likely include:**
- Becoming more aware of thresholds and how they affect the space
- Recognizing situations that would benefit from a different threshold
- Choosing what threshold to use based on what is needed and possible for people
- Shaping thresholds with words, energy, and context
- Adjusting your thresholds to respond to specific challenges

### 2nd session (Jun 12): Q&A and more practice

In the second session, we plan to explore any questions that came up for you in your week of practice and engage in additional practice.

Verene is an experienced facilitator and certified trainer in Nonviolent Communication. She has delivered training and facilitated group decisions in many grassroots contexts. Her immersion in the Nonviolent Global Liberation (NGL) community where CF is practiced daily gives her a deep grounding in the power of this approach to sustain ‚Äòradical collaboration‚Äô across differences of all sorts.   

Verene will support Roni in designing and delivering this workshop, as well as supporting participants in their learning journey. She and other members of the CF Holding Team within NGL will provide administrative and logistical support for the course.
