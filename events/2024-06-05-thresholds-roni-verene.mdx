When we ask questions or make requests, our wording and delivery deeply influence the responses we receive. How can we use thresholds effectively to support movement, collaboration, and connection?

The term threshold refers to encouraging or limiting the likelihood of people responding or objecting. In Convergent Facilitation, we aim to use thresholds that invite “just enough” interaction so we can move towards a decision without leaving anyone behind. We adjust our thresholds to help people speak up or step back depending on what serves the group the most in each moment. Supportive thresholds help the group stay together and save time by focusing on information that moves us forward.
