### About the Workshop

When we commit to making decisions that work for everyone, we often discover habits and ways of thinking that get in the way. Many people find it difficult to fully take in what matters to others without giving up on their own perspective. Even when everyone's needs are clear, we sometimes get stuck because we cannot imagine a solution that would care for all of them. In this workshop, we’ll explore pathways for transforming inner obstacles to integration. We plan to focus on one or two challenges in three core areas: holding our own needs without attachment, fully taking in the needs of others, and opening to creativity.

#### Common questions we may engage with:
- How can I connect with people's needs when they advocate for beliefs that I don't share, say others are wrong,  criticize me, or insist that their way is the only right option?
- What can I do when I just don't understand what is going on for the other person or they don't make any sense?
- How can I find out about someone's needs when they refuse to share them, say they don’t matter, or follow our conversation agreements?
- How do I keep my heart open and maintain my commitment to collaborative decisions when I believe that people don't care about my needs?
- What can I do when people hear my needs as demands or think that I am selfish?
- What if it's not possible to care for others’ needs without giving up on mine?
- What can I do when I have no idea how to find an integrative solution?
- What if the solutions people come up with don’t work for me?
