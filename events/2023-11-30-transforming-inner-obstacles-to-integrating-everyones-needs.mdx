When we commit to making decisions that work for everyone, we often discover habits and ways of thinking that get in the way. Many people find it difficult to fully take in what matters to others without giving up on their own perspective. Even when everyone's needs are clear, we sometimes get stuck because we cannot imagine a solution that would integrate all of them. In this workshop, we’ll explore pathways for transforming inner obstacles to integration. We plan to focus on one or two challenges in three core areas: holding our own needs without attachment, fully taking in the needs of others, and opening to creativity.

### Examples of questions we may explore
- How can I connect with people's needs when they advocate for beliefs that I don't share, criticize me, say others are wrong, or insist that their way is the only right option?
- What can I do when I just don't understand what is going on for the other person or they don't make any sense?
- How can I hear about someone's needs when they refuse to share them or follow our conversation agreements?
- How do I listen to others with an open heart when I believe that they don't care about my needs?
- What can I do when people hear my needs as demands or think that their needs are not as important?
- What if I can't track what's important to each person or what we are trying to do about it?
- What if it's not possible to care for others’ needs without giving up on mine?
- What can I do when I have no idea how to find an integrative solution?
- What if the solutions people come up with are not fair or not inclusive?
- Do you feel overwhelmed by the seeming controversy in the room?
- Do you notice yourself wanting to give priority to some needs over others?
- Do you experience tiredness in response to something people bring in?
