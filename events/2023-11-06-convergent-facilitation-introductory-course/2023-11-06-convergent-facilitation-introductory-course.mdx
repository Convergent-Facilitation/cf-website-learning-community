:::caution PLACEHOLDER EVENT
This is not an actual event that is going to happen. We put this event here to model how having content here would look like. 
:::

Would you like to support others – and yourself – in gently **moving toward more shared understanding** and integration **without requiring anyone to agree** on values or how we speak?

Roni is offering a series of **6** weekly framing coaching calls on **Sundays** at 10:00 am PST / 1:00 pm EST / 18:00 UTC / 19:00 CET, starting March 5 2023.

**First session: March 5 — last session: April 9**

<!--truncate-->

Come and practice your framing skills and expand your nonviolent consciousness!  Roni will offer coaching for your real life scenarios, and everyone is invited to support each other in learning together.


We’ll practice how to invite people into interdependence in your daily conversations, how to engage with judgements, and what do you do when someone makes a comment that holds an assumption of scarcity, separation, or powerlessness.


Turn your longing for change into concrete and consistent action with skills and habits you can use every day!


Not familiar with framing? No worries! You can register to watch the videos from [Roni’s Framing For Integration course](https://convergentfacilitation.org/fi?source=wfi) or just join us if you’re comfortable with some potential confusion until you figure out the basics.
