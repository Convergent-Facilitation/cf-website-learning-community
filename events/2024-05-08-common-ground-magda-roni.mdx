### How is this useful?

- When we learn to listen for needs within strategies, our main goal is usually to create a sense of connection.
- What happens when we have a sense of connection, but we are still in disagreement?
- How can a deeper understanding of people’s needs help us find solutions or make decisions that work for everyone?
- NVC offers a list of universal human needs to connect us with our shared humanity, but how can these single words help us decide what to do together?


### Who is this for? 

Everyone is welcome. Some experience with guessing needs using the NVC needs list would be helpful.

### Interactive Form

This event is a WORKSHOP, so everyone will have the opportunity to work in smaller groups. Be prepared to **turn on your camera and microphone** in the breakout room.

### Recording

We plan to record this event and make it available publicly. We may also use the recording for marketing on various social media. If you do not wish to be recorded, switch off your camera and microphone when in a main room for the whole duration of the session.

**Work in breakout rooms will not be recorded.**



## About Magda & Roni

### Magda Barańska

<img src="/img/magda-baranska.jpg" alt="Portrait Magda Baranska" className="round-image"/>

I feel a deep calling to contribute to making decisions that work for everyone because I see how much more alive and effective groups become when everyone’s needs matter. I believe humans intrinsically enjoy finding solutions that care for everyone’s needs and what gets in the way are unsupportive beliefs and lack of skills. I’m passionate about inspiring and supporting transformation of such beliefs and teaching the skills that make interdependent collaboration possible. I enjoy offering softness and acceptance to free up the energy that gets stuck in self-judgments and self-doubts. When facilitating I bring faith that integration is possible and trust in the wisdom and creativity of a group. It gives me great joy to contribute to co-creation through deep listening to everything that is shared and through the integration of dissent and concerns. I aim for each encounter and decision in my life to become an example of the change I want to see in the world. My ongoing sources of learning include collaborating in diverse projects, parenting and inner transformation.

### Roni Wiener

I dedicate my energy to accelerating the global shift toward decisions that care for all life.  I spend most of my time developing, teaching, and facilitating decision-making processes and interdependent systems. I focus on creating sustainable change that gradually integrates innovative practices.

I’m currently most passionate about supporting organizations and communities in cultivating a culture where everyone’s needs matter. I enjoy facilitating highly controversial and polarized decisions where I can contribute my integration skills to find creative solutions that work for everyone. I draw on gift economy principles to keep my work sustainable and prioritize the needs of people with less access to resources.

My life journey includes two decades of consulting focused on transforming collaboration practices. I also have a degree in Psychology, Sociology, and Gender Studies.
