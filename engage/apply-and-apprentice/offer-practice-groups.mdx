# Offer a Practice Group

:construction: :seedling: **WORK IN PROGRESS**  :seedling: :construction:

## Why offer a Practice Group
As someone who has likely gathered some Convergent Facilitation experience in the field already we invite you to offer an online Practice Group to the community. You will be the one holding the space, scheduling the call, bringing real-life challenges from your field of application or offering practice scenarios to the group.

We see offering a Practice Group as a crucial step for you to deepen your own practice. It is both a support for yourself in the sense that you will be able to process things that have happened and try something different, as well as prepare for upcoming applications that you have. It is also a service to the community, because for people who are just getting started with CF practising with a person who is bringing their challenges from the field provides a powerful learning opportunity.

## Steps to offer a Practice Group


### Decide on when and how often
- Decide on a day and time, rhythm and for how long you want to offer it (we recommend offering it for at least 4 times and recommend not offering it for longer than you really have juice for)


### Find a place (e.g. Zoom) to offer your session

If you have Zoom room or other service that you want to use for this feel free to use that one. If you need a Zoom room you can use our community Zoom room. 

### Optional: Request your own folder and group

### Draft your title and description

#### Title

We recommend that you chose a title
- that has "CF Practice Group" in it so people know that it is a CF Practice Group
- that has your name in it, so that people can easily recognize it
- possibly says something about the context 
- has a maximum of 50 characters (that's the limit for posts on Hylo, see below)

For example: **CF Practice Group w/ Menaka: CF in Communities** (46 characters) or **CF Practice Group w/ Fabian: CF with Children** (45 characters).
