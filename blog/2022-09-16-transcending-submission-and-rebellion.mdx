**The following Facilitation Insight is from Roni Wiener and was captured by Sabine Virani.**

I’ve recently started to work in a new organisation, and for this week’s tip I’d like to focus on having an integration lens – an orientation to integration – in everything we do. For example, as I decide what to work on in this new context, I want to collect considerations from different people, such as:

- What topics seem pressing to each person?
- What has frustrated them over time that no one has been caring for?
- What are they already working on that is really precious to them, and they don't want anyone else to disrupt?
- What ways of working are common and how do people feel about them?

And then I want to integrate this information, instead of defaulting to the common either/or of rebellion or submission. Rebellion means deciding to do what we think is best or what we think has to be done, regardless of what works for others. Submission means doing what we believe other people want us to do, even if it doesn’t work for us. In the oppressive culture we all live in, we're often given binary choices: either you make people do things, or you do what they're making you do. And I want to exit this framing by choosing to make decisions that care for everyone’s needs, including my own.

So as I think about what tasks I want to work on, I also ask myself:
> What am I excited about? What is aligned with my purpose? What is a good fit for my skills? What do I want to learn?

I then make a decision by considering what would care for my needs and everyone else’s. You can think of this as an internal version of criteria gathering and proposals.

You can also invite others to shift into more choice and integration. For example, you can offer a reframe whenever people ask you for permission. This happens often when I teach and people ask, “Can I ask you a question?” There is an inherent submission in questions like “can I” and “should I”: they have given me authority to decide whether or not we should hear their question, and they're going to do whatever I say.

I want to encourage a different way of thinking in spaces I hold, so I usually respond with a reframe that invites integration. The specific words I choose depend on the context, my relationship with the person, and what I believe would serve our purpose.

I’m offering a number of examples to support you in getting started with this practice. I invite you to adapt them to your situations and way of speaking.

I sometimes respond with an alternative question such as:
> Are you checking if asking a question now would fit well with my plans for this session?

This models how to ask for considerations instead of asking for permission. The new question creates space to share information that would allow us to decide together.

Another way I might reframe is to answer as if they asked me for information, rather than permission:
>I want to spend no more than five minutes on questions at this point, and I see two other people also have a question. Would you like to ask your question now or wait?

In this case, I am giving them considerations which will help them decide. I am modelling thinking about what everyone in the space needs as part of making a decision about how to attend to our needs. I am less likely to use this option if I sense the person might give up on their needs instead of integrating.

I sometimes narrow the range of options to what I am willing to do, for example:
> I would like to move on to the next topic, and it's important to me that everyone understands what we already covered first. If your question is about something you don’t understand I would like to answer it, and if it’s something new I would like to add it to our seed bag. Would that work for you?”

Or

> I'm willing to answer a question if you share it very briefly, preferably in just one or two sentences.

I am making a proposal, which raises the threshold for them to choose a different decision. Some people will hear it as me making a decision, and some will hear it as my preference and may still decide to do something different.

I can also make a unilateral decision. I don’t have to make a collaborative decision; it’s a choice I want to have. So I can say:
`“Right now, I want to share content that is really important to me to cover before we close. So I'm going to move on. Please add your question to the seed bag.”`

I want to highlight that even though, technically, I haven’t given them an option, people always have a choice. I'm just making the threshold really high. They can still say, “No, I want to ask this question now.” The choice is always there, and most people are very unlikely to cross the threshold if I say I'm moving on.

I often get creative with sharing considerations and proposals in response to the needs of the situation. I might say:
“I'm willing to hear the question, and then assess if I will be able to answer briefly.  If I sense that it's going to take a while to engage with it, I would like to defer it to the next session.”

I could come up with many more options, and the most important part is to not get stuck in the initial frame. When you hear “Can I do XYZ?” it’s easy to simply answer, “Yes, you can” or “No, you can’t”. The trick is to catch yourself and remember that you have other options.

Whenever we accept a request to grant or deny permission, we may be reproducing habits of submission and rebellion. We are also often making a decision without sufficient information about everyone’s needs. Reframing helps us see what would actually serve in that moment and find creative solutions. We can choose if we want to decide together and how much time we want to spend on considerations and proposals.

If you want to try other options, you are likely to find opportunities to practice this kind of reframing every day, because our culture habituates submission/rebellion questions in either/or frames. I invite you to listen for such questions in your own conversations, and experiment with reframing your responses in ways that encourage integration and collaborative decision-making.
