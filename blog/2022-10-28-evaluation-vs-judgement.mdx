*Introduction by Sabine: During the October session of Roni’s *Framing For Integration* course, a topic came up that piqued my interest: the difference between evaluations and judgements. Roni said it wasn’t sufficiently aligned with our purpose for the session, so we didn’t explore it then. Instead, I asked them to expand on the subject for this tip.*

*At the start of our conversation, Roni referenced Marshall Rosenberg’s book, which prompted me to pull my copy of *Nonviolent Communication: a Language of Compassi*on off the shelf. I notice a chapter called ‘Observing Without Evaluation’ in which Marshall effectively uses the term ‘evaluation’ as a *synonym* for ‘judgement’, while we’re trying to tease them apart here. So rather than get tied up in semantics, I invite us into seeing how Roni sees these and related terms, to be open to how their thoughts might bring us new insights and agency.*

*In Roni’s experience, summaries of NVC principles often lump terms for human interpretations – evaluation, assessment, analysis, discernment, judgement – into a single category. “I want to separate these terms out,” Roni says, “because if we put them all in one box and say we want to avoid judgements, then I can no longer have an opinion about anything. And we need to have opinions to make decisions. We need to be able to analyse and evaluate things, so we can decide what to do.” After all, the purpose of Convergent Facilitation (CF) is to help us make decisions about what would work for everyone, which inherently includes some discernment.*

*To help make useful distinctions, Roni introduces the term **separating judgements**, which are **evaluations of other people, that generalise and reduce the complexity of someone's humanity**. Here Roni explains further:*

“So let's look at evaluating a person as an example. If I say that you are lazy and unreliable, those are separating judgements. We can imagine some observations behind those judgements; for example, maybe sometimes you say you will do things and then you don't do them. But when I make this generic statement that you’re unreliable, it makes it sound as if you never follow through on anything. It creates a blanket generalisation and it doesn't have useful information in it. People who practise NVC usually know how to share observations instead of judgements. So they might say ‘I notice that sometimes when you say you will do something by a certain date, you don't do it by that date.’

“The observation is useful, and I also want to have space to add my *interpretation* to that. My interpretation might be, ‘I think I see a pattern that you tend to not do things whenever there's too much on your plate.’ *This piece is not an observation, but for me, it's also not a judgement*. I don't think that it's wrong or bad that you're doing this thing, or if I do, I didn't express it. I am just sharing my assessment of what is going on.

“To take another example, let's say that you often show up to meetings later than we agreed. In separating judgement language, I might say that you don't care enough about our work or that you’re bad at time management. In observation language, I might say I noticed that when we schedule meetings, you usually arrive five to ten minutes after the scheduled start time. If I only share observations because I want to avoid judgements, I’m missing out on an opportunity to offer insights about why this might be happening. I want to have a space to still be able to share my perspective. So I might say, ‘I’m wondering if there's a part of you that actually doesn't want to be at these meetings, but you feel pressure to be here, and that’s why you show up later.’ Of course, I always want to share my assessments and interpretations from a place of humility and with openness to the possibility that they are not accurate.

“I could be accurate or inaccurate in my assessment, and either way, it's different than a judgement. Again, I’m *not separating* from you. There's nothing in me that has a sense that you *should* want to be here, or that you *shouldn't* feel pressure, or that you *should* be arriving on time. I might also have an assessment that this behaviour pattern is reducing the effectiveness of our meetings. So again, this is an evaluation or an interpretation. It's my opinion that our meetings will be more effective if you showed up on time, and it's *not a judgement about what should be happening*. I want us to hold that distinction, so that we are not shying away from having opinions about things because we don't want to judge people.”

I’m appreciating hearing these nuances, and then I wonder if ‘discernment’ is just another way of saying ‘evaluation’. Back to Roni:

“**Discernment** is the part where we're trying to assess what it makes sense to *do*. If I’m wanting to discern, for example, what we might want to do to make our meetings more effective, as part of that discernment, I’m going to include my evaluations. Whenever we evaluate a proposal, we are forming an opinion about whether it would attend to all the needs or considerations. This is why we say that criteria are evaluated *subjectively*. Each person has their own interpretation of how a proposal would attend to needs and if it’s sufficiently likely to attend to them.

“Every decision we make includes our evaluations of what is happening, why it's happening, and what might serve purpose and care for the whole more efficiently, with more ease, and with more togetherness.

“Ideally, we also want to receive some feedback or check if our assessments are accurate. Whenever I have some assessment or interpretation of someone else, I want to check if it is true for them. If that’s not possible – the person is not available or is not willing to talk – I want to check with others. I also want to check on my assessments of myself! Sometimes others see us very differently than we do. Every decision is different, and a part of the discernment is deciding how much energy to put into exploring and verifying different assessments.

As we move to wrapping up, Roni adds an important piece: that it's not always easy to tell the difference between evaluations and separating judgements!

“For example, if I want to introduce a more structured agenda to our meeting because I want our meetings to be more efficient, it can be an evaluation or assessment on my part about what will be efficient, or I could also be holding some judgements. There could be a story inside me that ‘meetings should move fast’ or that ‘good meetings cover a lot of agenda items’. **So it's not always that easy to tell if what I’m holding is an assessment or discernment about the situation, or if what I’m holding is expectations, habits, or ideas about what should or shouldn't be happening**.

“I want to check carefully with myself, especially when I’m assessing other people. I sometimes also check with others, especially if I think I might hold separating judgements about this person or some reactivity about what is happening. Am I assessing that the way this person is contributing is interfering with our team functioning? Is that an assessment based on things that I’ve observed and my intuitive sense of what would work for the team? Or am I holding some judgements about how people should be doing work, especially when people are very different from me? It's easy to think that we're just assessing what works and what doesn't work, and what we're *actually* doing is judging that someone’s ways of working are not as efficient or not the right way to do things. There are many ways to achieve outcomes, so it doesn't have to look a certain way.

“If I have a theory about why some project didn’t achieve the outcomes we wanted, it's always possible that it's something else. So I also want to hold humility, to be open and curious. I might discover that what I thought was an assessment of the situation was either not an accurate assessment, or it was actually some judgements that I’m holding about what is the best outcome for a project. Maybe the best thing that could have happened for that project is for us to have a major conflict, and we all learn a lot from it, and we now have more trust. Or maybe we discovered that a couple of people were not sufficiently aligned with our vision and our purpose, and they ended up leaving. And now we have a stronger team and these two other people are going to find something that is more in alignment for them, and that's great.

“I sometimes discover that an outcome really served our purpose, even when it was very easy in the moment to label it as failure.”

I appreciate the invitation into humility, care and curiosity. And I can see how the distinctions Roni teased out above can help me to deepen my self-awareness and my skills as a human navigating the everyday complexities of life. I hope it may be true for you as well.
