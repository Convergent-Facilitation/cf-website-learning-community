For me, there’s been an air of mystery in Convergent Facilitation around the process of transforming what I would call a ‘raw criterion’ into its noncontroversial essence (NCE). On the surface, it’s a simple matter of reframing, yet it feels more like alchemy than something I could reliably achieve in a formal group setting. So this week I asked Roni for some coaching on how to do it. Roni started with an example from their recent work on a proposal to prevent violence to children in preschools. During the first criteria gathering session, one person said “I don’t want too many rules.” For Roni, this ‘raw criterion' exemplifies two common things that show up during criteria gathering.

The first is that **people often say what they *don’t* want, instead of what they *do* want**. When this happens, the facilitator’s task is to flip the criterion around, so it specifies what the person *does* want. Roni asked me to try to imagine I was the person who didn’t want too many rules. “What would it give you, if we had very few rules?”, Roni asked. I took a guess: “simplicity?” Roni noted that people who come from an NVC background (yup, that’s me) often give a one-word answer, and they encouraged me instead to use three or four words, or even a full sentence. So I made another guess: “I want the number of rules to be small enough so people can remember them all?”

Which brought us to the second common thing: that **the criterion already has a strategy within it**. “Rules are a strategy,” Roni said, “so I want to check if it makes sense to include them in the NCE. People often include assumptions about what the proposal or decision is going to include. If you guess “so you want to include as few rules as possible?” you may reinforce the assumption that we plan to make rules. As the facilitator, you can reframe your guesses to remove strategies. For example, you could ask, ‘so you want our proposal to be within everyone's ability to remember?’ Phrased like this, we keep the essence of being able to remember, and we're not making any assumptions about whether there would even be any rules.

Over time, you develop a sense of how much you want to shift each criterion away from strategy, toward the underlying need. We need to move toward needs if a criterion is controversial, but sometimes we want to do it for other reasons. Removing specific strategies creates space for more creativity later in the CF process, and provides more clarity about the ‘why’ behind the ‘what’. At the same time, we want to keep enough specificity to be able to evaluate proposals later. So we don’t want to move so far toward needs that we can’t tell if a proposal attends to the criterion.

Another recommendation from Roni is to always make guesses about the underlying needs, rather than asking questions such as “why is that important?” And don’t worry about making wrong guesses: it may feel counterintuitive, but guessing wrong is actually helpful, they assure me. “Your guessing – whether right or wrong – is going to help the person tell you what they actually want.” People often have trouble answering open questions about what they want. They may not have clarity, or they may find the questions intimidating or overwhelming. Some people feel tension about “why” questions because they’re associated with needing to justify your actions or preferences. It’s much easier to correct an inaccurate guess. By guessing, you give people a chance to check in with themselves, to dig a bit deeper, to see what resonates, to connect to their needs.

Whenever we guess, we check carefully if what we offer resonates and captures all the needs. In the rules example, the first guess was about being able to remember. “If they answer ‘yes!’, the criterion could become ‘we want the process to be within people's ability to remember.’ However, they might answer, ‘It’s not about remembering. I think rules are really rigid, and what happens when we have a lot of rules is that we don't have flexibility to respond to situations.’ In which case, the criterion could become ‘We want the process to provide flexibility in choosing how to respond to situations.’”

Of course, it’s not necessarily either/or: it could be that they want to be able to remember *and* they want to be able to respond flexibly. In that case we would add both criteria to the list, after checking that neither is controversial. But if it’s only one, we don’t want both on the list. Roni’s advice is to **keep the criteria list as short as possible, and as detailed as necessary**.

There was more to our conversation about unearthing the NCE, but I’m saving that for next week. For now, I’m remembering the first tip I wrote up in July, when Roni encouraged me to consider my own capacity when deciding how long a piece we might write for the newsletter. It’s getting late, so I’ll stop here for now, also remembering Miki Kashtan’s article on “The Radical Implications of Staying within Capacity”, which posits it’s an act of courage and liberation to assess and honour our limits. With those sweet, powerful words, I’m off to bed!
