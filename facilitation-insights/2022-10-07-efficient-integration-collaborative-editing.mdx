This week’s Facilitation Insight is a live example from the Convergent Facilitation (CF) community. With the CF Intensive course coming up, a lot of outreach materials need to be created: Facebook posts, newsletters, team bios, FAQs. There’s a lot of writing and editing to be done in a set period of time.

“In a collaborative working environment where you want to be integrating what's important to everyone, I often see people getting frustrated by a sense of constantly needing to wait for others,” Roni tells me. Then they describe a scenario where a team member writes some material for the Intensive and asks everybody if they have any concerns. Two weeks pass before everyone has given their feedback, which the author then integrates, only to find something new comes up, requiring more changes and another round of waiting for everybody else to review it again. I want to lie down just hearing this! “To me, it just feels like moving through mud,” says Roni. “And it reinforces common beliefs that integration is slow and inefficient.”

With this situation in mind, Roni suggests a few approaches to support efficient integration in collaborative editing. You could:

* **Ask people to review at a higher threshold** or only express significant concerns, which will reduce the number of changes. For example, rather than broadly asking people to edit as needed, you could ask, “Did I miss anything that's really important to you?” or “Do you see anything that you can’t live with?”
* **Use short review timeframes** when sending draft text, and let people know in advance so they can plan. For example, you could tell people that next Tuesday you plan to finish the draft and give everyone two days to comment. Those who choose to prioritise it may give feedback, and whoever doesn't get to it, doesn’t get to it.
* **Do the editing together to avoid the back and forth**. Roni finds it most efficient if people just come together to integrate. And sometimes it can be difficult to arrange: these days, with global teams spread over multiple time zones, even scheduling a ten-minute meeting can be challenging.
* **Move toward more entrustment**. Take some time at the start for everyone to share their needs in general, and then trust that individual authors will hold them with care. This could mean that some things don’t go through a review before you publish them, or that you only include one or two reviewers. It also means trusting how each writer chooses to integrate feedback, and trusting that we can attend to any unwanted impacts if we miss something important.

Roni says, “**I want us to** **trust each other, so that if someone chooses to not integrate something, I will trust that from where they sit, it makes sense.** **And it doesn't mean what I’m bringing up isn’t important or useful.** I want to trust that given what they know and their capacity, they are making a decision that best cares for all the needs. At the same time, it doesn't mean if somebody says ‘no’ we just give up. If it’s a really high threshold for me, I want to check that they fully took in the needs and potential impacts. If, for example, the content they wrote is not in compliance with some legal requirement, and I’m concerned that the organisation will get sued, I might come back again to explain my concerns and say ‘I hear that you don't want to integrate it right now, and I’m concerned about the impacts it could have on our community. Does that shift anything for you?’ And I still want to be open to a ‘no’.”

Having rattled off the above suggestions, Roni then shared an example of another approach they tried recently that worked really well. Those who have been reading these coaching tips will spot an ongoing thread about developing our skills for integration by tracking what’s important to people without needing to ask. This is how Roni tells it:

“I received some draft text for integration to review and edited it to include what's important to me. I then sent it on to the next and final reviewer, who made significant changes. The new version lost some of what mattered to me, so I wanted to edit it again.

“My first thought was to ask what was important to them about these changes, so I could integrate their needs and mine into a final version. And then I thought, that's going to slow us down again. So instead, I compared my version to theirs and asked myself, ‘Can I guess the non-controversial essence behind their changes?’ By comparing the texts, I guessed what was important to this person. First, the new version was half the length, so I guessed that one thing that was important to them was taking up less space on the screen where it will be posted. My second guess was that they wanted it to be similar to other things on that page, and each is a single paragraph. They also moved some content around, placing some of it earlier, and my guess was they wanted this content to be emphasised or to be seen at a glance.

“I didn't like the new order because I wanted more flow and consistency. By guessing that they needed this one piece to be highlighted, I could find another way to highlight it, without it being the first thing in the sequence. By guessing needs, I was able to reintegrate the things that were important to me that had been lost, without losing what was important to them. The person's response was that they really enjoyed my new version: they didn’t have concerns, and we were *done*!

“Beyond the benefits of guessing needs, this experience also reminds me to create agreements or to **ask people to include their underlying needs when they make significant changes – make their ‘why’ explicit**. Then, if someone else doesn’t like some changes, it’s easier to make more changes without losing something that was important to the previous editor. If we don’t have the noncontroversial essence, it is much harder to integrate and we often end up with multiple review cycles. I have the changes they made, so I have their *preferences*, but I don’t know the underlying needs or purpose.”

At this point, I had to ask Roni if they gave *their* ‘whys’ in the example above. And their response was instructive:

“I would have given my ‘whys’ if I was open to them making more changes on their own. I wasn't. Which takes us to our starting point: I want to increase our efficiency by reducing the cycles of back-and-forth editing. The other thing I did was raise the threshold of engagement, by asking if this version works for them, rather than asking them to edit.”

Having shared this example, Roni then highlighted an important principle: we want **to catch ourselves and others whenever we are thinking that integration *takes too long*, or that we *have* to wait for people, or that we don’t want to work on something because we will then have to make everyone like it or agree to it.** It helps to catch tensions and frustrations early. We can then name our concerns or assumptions and make a choice about what to do differently.

Roni says, “I don't *have to* wait for anyone, *and* I don't want to flip from submission to rebellion and take action without considering other people’s needs, as we talked about previously*. Instead, I want to invite everyone to hold a much more inspiring story, like ‘I wonder how quickly we can get this done in a way that would work for everyone?’, or ‘What creative ideas do all of us have? Is there something we haven’t tried yet that might move us along faster and still together?’”

I wonder if these questions inspire your creative juices. We are working on creating an interactive community space on the updated CF website, where we’d love to hear from you about your challenges and successes with efficient integration.
