*Introduction by Sabine: ‘Mind the Gap’ is a well-known phrase from the London Underground, reminding everyone to take care when moving between the platform and the trains: you need to stretch a bit to make sure you don’t fall in the space between. With regard to decision making, there’s a wide gap between how this typically happens now and how it can happen with Convergent Facilitation (CF), and sometimes it’s not possible to stretch far enough to bridge the gulf. Unlike on the underground, though, with CF it *is* safe – and sometimes beneficial – to take baby steps. In this week’s tip, Roni uses a workplace scenario to illustrate.*

Let’s say the leader of an organisation is consulting with me on a decision about moving the office. And let’s say they have never done any integrative decision-making in their lives: they’re used to being in charge, trusting their instincts, telling people what to do and expecting their decisions to be implemented. Then it’s a huge shift for me to ask them to move from that into fully collaborative decision making.

I might say, ‘I think it’s important to include the needs of everyone who’s impacted by this decision so the decision works for everyone and receives support.’ If the leader responds, ‘We don't have time, this is an urgent decision with very high costs,’ I have a choice. I can advocate for the benefits of involving more people and offer efficient ways to do it, or I can accept – given the circumstances and the impacts on those people if we wait – that maybe for this decision, we'll make it now and then acknowledge to them that we chose to prioritise reducing known impacts over integrating more of what they're holding.

If I sense there might be a chance for *some* integration, I want to look for openings and baby steps. Are there any known or easily imagined considerations that we can include? Is there willingness to hear some input from people before the decision is finalised? Is there a person everyone trusts who might be able to represent most needs in a quick conversation?

I don't want us to be rigid about CF, insisting that we *should* be including everyone's needs, we *should* be getting the non-controversial essence, and we *should* be making a decision that works for everyone. These are the things we want to move toward, that exemplify our vision of a world where we care for everyone's needs. And we don't want to be so attached to them that we move to separation and judge people because they aren’t making decisions the way we want.

I want to come in with a lot of tenderness and empathy for people who make unilateral decisions without integration, both for why they are choosing to make decisions in this way, and for the amount of effort and transformation it would take for them to start doing things differently. For example, I want to acknowledge the responsibility they hold for the decision, and that if it doesn't go well, they will be the person held accountable for it.

Sometimes people hold the belief that collaborative decision making will take longer, and that is not my experience, even though technically, unilateral decision making is faster. The latter tends to be quicker up front, then takes much longer in attending to the resulting impacts. It's very fast to just decide to move the office, if you don’t include the time it takes to attend to the consequences: hearing all of the complaints, arguments and disagreements; replacing employees who quit; talking to people who refuse to follow the plan; addressing aspects of the move that don’t go smoothly – all things that are more likely to happen when the decision maker doesn’t have sufficient information about how the move will affect everyone. The aftermath may take far more time than it would have taken to integrate everyone's needs up front. And time isn’t the only cost. There are also the costs of building up resentment, reducing trust and eroding relationships that go way beyond any individual decision.

Even as we can see these costs, I want us to really try to hold the perspective of the decision maker. It's very likely that they believe there is no better alternative. Perhaps in their experience, when they try to get considerations from other people, it does not go well: people argue with them, they're not able to find something that works for everyone, they invest a lot of energy and time, and it doesn't actually lead to a collaborative decision.

It might be that they are very overstretched and cannot imagine how they would find the time or energy to integrate what people are holding. It might be that people hold a lot of judgments about them as ‘the boss’, and when they ask, people don't tell them the truth, and don't actually share with them what's important to them.

Part of our work is accepting that there's a huge gap between where we are in the world right now, and where we want to be. We can mourn and release places where we cannot bridge that gap right at the moment, and continue to form bridges where we can.”

It would be great to hear your examples of where you’ve been able to make small steps toward integrated decision making.
